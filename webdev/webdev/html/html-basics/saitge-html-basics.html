        Character encoding is a system that pairs each character in a given set with something else—such as a
        number or a sequence of bytes—so that text can be stored and transmitted in a computer system.  -->

    <!-- Paragraphs contain text. The <strong> tag is used to bold words. -->

   <a href="https://www.example.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Visit Example Website</a>
    
    <!-- Anchor tags (<a>) create links. The 'href' attribute specifies the link's destination. -->
    <!-- The 'target="_blank"' makes the link open in a new tab. 
        Use rel="noopener" when using target="_blank"-->

    <!-- The `<br/>` HTML element is used to insert a line break in text. 
    It's an empty element, meaning it doesn't have a closing tag. 
    When you use `<br/>`, it forces the text following it to start on a new line. 
    This is particularly useful for formatting text in a way that requires line 
    breaks, such as in poems or addresses. In our case, we want a couple of 
    lines to provide separation between the button and image -->
