**Before cloning a respository, consider:**
   - The location where the respository will be downloaded to.
   - The repository will be be downloaded to the folder the Git command is run from.
   - The full contents of the respository is downloaded onto the local drive.
   - Backup of your development folder.

**Recommendations**

It is recommended that your development folder is a private respository.  Respositories have version control and are designed for development.  Respositories such as Github allow secure access to your development code from anywhere, anytime, anyplace.

1. **Sign In**: Log in to your GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can sign up at github.com.

2. **Create a New Repository (Private)**:
   - Click the **+** icon in the top right corner and select **New repository (Private)**.
   - Alternatively, you can go to github.com/new.

3. **Repository Details**:
   - **Repository Name**: Enter a name for your repository.
   - **Description**: (Optional) Add a short description of your repository.
   - **Public/Private**: Choose whether your repository will be public or private.

4. **Initialize Repository**:
   - You can initialize the repository with a README file, which is a good practice.
   - Optionally, you can add a `.gitignore` file to specify which files should be ignored by Git.
   - You can also choose a license for your repository.

5. **Create Repository**: Click the **Create repository** button.
6. **Once created**, you can clone your respository to a local folder and add files and folders.
7. **Be sure** when working with respositories,  be sure to `sync` with the remote repository before making changes to the clone respository.
