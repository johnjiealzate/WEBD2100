### Step 1: HTML Structure

The **HTML structure** is the foundation of every webpage. It typically begins with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. Here's a simple example:

```html
<!--
    The HTML structure is the foundation of every webpage. 
    It begins with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, 
    followed by the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. 
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Basic HTML Elements Tutorial</title>
    <!-- The title you see on the browser tab -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="saitge-html-css-js-basics-styles.css">
    <!-- Linking external CSS file -->
</head>
<body>
    <div class="logo-area">
        <img src="saitge-nscc-logo-wht.png" alt="NSCC Logo - A description of the image">
    </div>
        <!-- Key Points about the <div> Tag:  
        Container Element: The <div> tag is primarily used to group 
        block-level elements to format them with CSS or to manipulate 
        them with JavaScript.

        Block-Level Element: By default, <div> is a block-level element, 
        meaning it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
        
        Styling and Layout: You can apply CSS styles to a <div> to control its 
        appearance, such as background color, borders, margins, padding, and more.
        
        Class and ID Attributes: The <div> tag often uses the class and id 
        attributes to apply specific styles or to target the element with 
        JavaScript. -->
    <h1>Welcome to HTML CSS and JavaScript Basics!</h1>
    <!-- This is a level-1 heading. It is often used as the main title of the webpage. -->

    <p>This is a simple paragraph to demonstrate the usage of <strong>HTML elements</strong>.</p>
    <!-- Paragraphs contain text. The <strong> tag is used to bold words. -->

    <a href="https://www.example.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Visit Example Website</a>
    
    <!-- Anchor tags (<a>) create links. The 'href' attribute specifies the link's destination. -->
    <!-- The 'target="_blank"' makes the link open in a new tab. 
        Use rel="noopener" when using target="_blank"-->

    <ul>
        <!-- Unordered List -->
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- <ul> creates an unordered list with bullet points, and <li> is for each list item. -->

    <ol>
        <!-- Ordered List -->
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- <ol> creates an ordered list with numbers. -->

    <button type="button" id="clickMe">Click Me</button>
    <!-- Button element with an id attribute. We will use this with JavaScript. -->
    <div id="button_status" class="button-state"></div>
    <script src="saitge-html-css-js-basics-script.js"></script>
    <!-- Linking an external JavaScript file to add interactivity. The HTML
    elements must be loaded into the document object model (DOM) before any execution 
    of javascript.  Without an event listener to monitor the DOM, reference to
    the javascript must be at the end of the body -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: Adding Style with CSS

CSS is used to style HTML elements. We will create an external CSS file called `styles.css` to make our page look better.

```css
/* styles.css */

/* CSS Selector by element name */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    /* Applying a general font for the body text */
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    /* Light gray background for the body */
}

/* CSS Selector by element name */
h1 {
    color: #333;
    /* Dark color for the heading */
}

/* CSS Selector by class name */
.button-state {
    color: #dc0c0c;
    /* Red color for the message */
}

/* CSS Selector by class name */
.logo-area {
    background-color: #004477;
    /* Light gray background for the body */
}

/* CSS Selector by element name */
p {
    font-size: 16px;
    color: #555;
    /* Styling paragraphs with a slightly smaller font and gray text */
    line-height: 1.6;
}

/* CSS Selector by element name */
a {
    color: #0066cc;
    text-decoration: none;
    /* Styling the anchor links with a blue color and removing the underline */
}

/* CSS Selector by element name and state */
a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    /* Underline the link when hovered */
}

/* CSS Selector by element name */
ul, ol {
    margin-left: 20px;
    /* Adding some space to the left for the lists */
}

/* CSS Selector by element name */
button {
    display: inline;
    margin: 20px auto;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    background-color: #28a745;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
    /* Styling the button */
}

/* CSS Selector by element name and state */
button:hover {
    background-color: #218838;
    /* Change the button color when hovered */
}

```

### Step 3: Adding Interactivity with JavaScript

We will create a simple JavaScript file (`script.js`) that interacts with the button and outputs to the console and to the DIV element.

```javascript
// script.js

// Selecting the button element by its ID
const BUTTON = document.getElementById('clickMe');
// Selecting the DIV element by its ID
const BUTTON_STATUS = document.getElementById('button_status');

// Adding an event listener to respond when the button is clicked
BUTTON.addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('Button was clicked!');
    // This message will be displayed in the browser console when the button is clicked
    
    // Un-comment this code to change the button text
    // BUTTON.innerHTML = "Button was Clicked";
    // Change the button text when the button is clicked

    BUTTON_STATUS.innerHTML = "Button was clicked"
});
```

### Step 4: Viewing the Output in the Console

Once the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are linked, open the webpage in your browser and perform the following steps:

1. **Right-click on the page** and select **"Inspect"** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac). This will open the Developer Tools.
2. Click on the **"Console"** tab.
3. **Click the button** on the webpage. You will see the message `"Button was clicked!"` appear in the console.

### Final Notes

- **HTML Comments**: Comments in HTML are written as `<!-- This is a comment -->`. They do not appear in the rendered page but are helpful for documenting the code.
- **CSS Comments**: CSS comments are written as `/* This is a comment */` and can be placed anywhere in the CSS code.
- **JavaScript Comments**: In JavaScript, comments can be written as `// Single line comment` or `/* Multi-line comment */`.

---

### Example Output

- **HTML Elements**: Headings, paragraphs, lists, and buttons will be displayed on the page.
- **CSS Styles**: The background will be light gray, the heading will be centered, and the button will be styled with a green background.
- **Console Output**: When clicking the button, you will see the message `"Button was clicked!"` in the browser's console.
