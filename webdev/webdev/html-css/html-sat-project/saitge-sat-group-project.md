### **Group Assignment: Modern Web Design Practices - Accessibility, Usability, and HTML/CSS Development**

#### **Overview:**
This group assignment will take you through key stages of modern web design, focusing on accessibility, usability, and hands-on coding with HTML and CSS. The project is divided into two main phases: 
**Phase 1: Accessibility Assessment & Initial Wireframing** **Phase 2: HTML/CSS Prototyping** As a group, you’ll perform accessibility and usability analysis, build wireframes for the website structure, and create a functional, responsive HTML/CSS prototype.

### **Assignment Steps**

### **Phase 1: Accessibility & Usability Assessment and Wireframing**

#### **1. Conducting an Accessibility and Usability Assessment**

**Objective**: Perform an accessibility and usability analysis of an existing website using WCAG 2.1 standards to inform design decisions for your project.

1. **Group Task**: Select a well-known website that reflects modern design practices.
   
2. **Tools**: Use online accessibility tools like **WAVE** (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) to conduct an initial accessibility assessment.
   
3. **Assessment Report**:
   - **Identify accessibility issues** such as color contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation, and ARIA roles.
   - Document usability concerns related to user navigation, readability, and content layout.
   - **Submit a 3-4 page report** with:
     - Key findings from the WAVE analysis.
     - Suggested accessibility and usability improvements.
     - Reflections from each group member on the evaluation.

4. **Peer Review**:
   - Exchange reports with another group for peer review.
   - Each group provides feedback and additional suggestions for accessibility improvement.
   - Peer feedback should be appended to the final assessment report.

#### **2. Initial Design and Wireframing**

**Objective**: Based on the accessibility and usability findings, create HTML-focused wireframes for the main website structure.

1. **Wireframe the Main Page Layout**:
   - Collaboratively design a **wireframe of the main page** layout, emphasizing a header with navigation links and a footer section.
   - Draft a **navigation structure** in line with user-centered design principles.
   - Plan HTML element structure with accessibility-focused tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`).

2. **Header and Navigation Design (Base Template)**:
   - Create a wireframe layout for the **base template** header, including structured HTML tags for accessibility and ease of use.
   - Define layout options for navigation using **Flexbox** and **Grid**.

3. **Individual Hero Section Wireframe**:
   - Each group member independently designs a **hero section** layout as an introduction to the website, including a title, subtitle, and call-to-action buttons.
   - Use appropriate HTML elements and structure, and choose a **color palette** and **typography** based on contrast and readability requirements.
   - Submit a wireframe for the hero section along with a style guide outlining your design choices, including buttons and iconography.

**Deliverables for Phase 1**:
   - Group Accessibility & Usability Assessment Report (including peer review feedback).
   - Main Page and Header Wireframe.
   - Individual Hero Section Wireframe with chosen color palette, typography, and HTML structural tags.

### **Phase 2: HTML/CSS Prototype Development**

#### **Objective**: Build a fully functional, interactive HTML/CSS prototype of a responsive website based on the wireframes and feedback from Phase 1.

1. **Group Task - Main Page & Base Template**:
   - Build a **main page layout** using HTML5 and CSS3, focusing on structuring each section (header, main content, and footer) for accessibility and responsive design.
   - Ensure the layout is responsive using **CSS Flexbox** and **Grid**, adjusting for different screen sizes.
   - Include ARIA roles and semantic HTML tags for a screen-reader-friendly structure.

2. **Individual Task - Hero Section Prototype**:
   - Each member builds an HTML/CSS prototype for their hero section wireframe.
   - Ensure that all chosen color schemes meet WCAG contrast standards, and apply accessible typography.
   - Independently style buttons, icons, and interactive elements for your hero section.

3. **Building a Responsive Prototype**:
   - Implement responsive design principles across both the main and hero sections.
   - Test your HTML and CSS files for consistency across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using developer tools.
   - Integrate your HTML structure with CSS styling for layout (CSS Flexbox and Grid) and interactivity.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Validate HTML and CSS for WCAG 2.1 compliance using online validators.
   - Run final accessibility tests using WAVE to ensure all accessibility standards are met.

**Deliverables for Phase 2**:
   - Functional HTML/CSS prototype of the main page with a responsive, accessible layout.
   - Individual hero section HTML/CSS prototypes for comparison.
   - Documentation of each member’s contribution and any updates based on testing and feedback.
