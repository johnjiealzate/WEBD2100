### **Objective:**
This assignment guides you through the complete design process of a Django CRUD web application, from initial wireframing to styling with CSS and accessibility testing. By the end of this project, you will have designed a fully wireframed, accessible, and standards-compliant application that performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functions for managing route data.

### **Project Requirements:**
You will create and style five primary pages for this project:

1. **Base Template:** The foundation for all templates, including a header with navigation links, and a footer with typical information.
2. **CRUD Templates:** Four pages, each with a specific function:
   - **Route List** - Displays all available routes.
   - **Route Create** - Allows users to add a new route.
   - **Route Update** - Allows users to modify an existing route.
   - **Route Delete** - Confirms deletion of a route.

### **Design Phases:**

#### **Phase 1: Wireframing**
Using Figma, create clear wireframes for the base template and each CRUD page:

1. **Base Template**
   - **Header with Navigation:** Design a reusable header with navigation links for:
     - Home
     - Route List
     - Add Route
     - Contact/Help (if applicable)
   - **Footer:** Include typical footer information:
     - Copyright statement
     - Contact details
     - Additional links (e.g., Privacy Policy, Terms of Use)
   - **Responsive Design:** Design layouts for both desktop and mobile views.

2. **CRUD Templates**
   - **Route List Page:** Displays a list or table of routes with action links for “Edit” and “Delete” beside each entry. Include an “Add Route” button.
   - **Route Create Page:** A form allowing users to add a new route, with fields like route name, description, origin, destination, etc.
   - **Route Update Page:** Similar to Route Create but pre-populated with existing data.
   - **Route Delete Page:** A confirmation page with a warning message and options to “Confirm Delete” or “Cancel.”

#### **Phase 2: Design & Styling with CSS**
After finalizing wireframes, use Figma’s design tools to apply styles and simulate CSS for each page layout.

1. **Semantic HTML Structure:** Arrange content using semantic HTML elements as much as possible (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
2. **CSS Styling:** Define a consistent style guide for:
   - **Colors and Typography:** Use accessible color contrast and readable font sizes.
   - **Button and Form Styles:** Ensure buttons are distinct and intuitive, and form fields are clearly labeled.
   - **Consistent Layout:** Use CSS to simulate padding, margin, alignment, and spacing across pages for a cohesive look.
3. **CSS Design for Responsiveness:** Adjust layouts for mobile and desktop displays.

#### **Phase 3: Accessibility & W3C Compliance**
Evaluate and adjust your designs to meet accessibility and web standards.

1. **Accessibility Testing:** Use Figma's plugins (like Stark or Contrast) to check color contrast, keyboard navigation, and form accessibility.
   - Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons) are accessible via keyboard.
   - Design with high-contrast color schemes to support visual accessibility.
   - Clearly label form fields and include accessible error messaging.
2. **W3C Compliance:** Follow W3C guidelines for valid, accessible, and semantic HTML/CSS.
   - Use appropriate tags, avoid inline styling, and adhere to standards for CSS structure.
   - Refer to [W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for full compliance criteria.
   - Validate your pages using the W3C VAlidator service https://validator.w3.org/.  
   When using the validator services, it may be best to use the internal CSS method where the CSS is contained within the HTML document between the tags `<script></script>` located in the `<head>` section of the HTML page.

#### **Phase 4: Feedback and Refinement**
Once the initial design is complete, share your Figma file with the instructor for feedback. Use the “Share” feature to provide a view/comment link.

- **Instructor Feedback:** Review any comments or suggestions from the instructor and make necessary revisions to improve your design.
- **Final Review:** Ensure all pages align with accessibility standards and design best practices before submission.

### **Deliverables:**

1. **Wireframe and Styled Designs in Figma:** Submit a single Figma file with organized frames for each page, fully styled to simulate CSS.
   - Base Template
   - Route List Page
   - Route Create Page
   - Route Update Page
   - Route Delete Page

2. **CSS Style Guide:** Document your style choices (fonts, colors, and spacing) in Figma, ensuring they meet W3C and WCAG standards.

3. **Accessibility Report:** Include a brief summary (100-150 words) explaining how your design meets accessibility requirements and W3C compliance.

4. **File Sharing:** Share the Figma project link on the course platform with view/comment access for the instructor.
